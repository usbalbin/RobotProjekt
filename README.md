# RobotProjekt
A robo project just for fun and for learning some coding and robotics.

My idea is to make a raspberry-pi/arduino-controlled robot with Simultaneous localization and Mapping.
The arduino will control the hardware: motors, distance sensors. While the Raspberry will do the thinking: pathfinding,
adding obstacles to the map etc.
